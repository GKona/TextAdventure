                    You are walking down a street all by your lonesome.<br />
                    It occurs to you that you've forgotten where you were going in the first place.
                    As you stand there seemingly brain dead, you notice a wallet before your feet.
                    The streets appear earily silent as you scan your surrounding for the owner of the wallet and or cops.
                    <br />
                    ..."Pick it up already!", the thought echoes in your mind over and over again,
                    as if a greater power is attempting to pass great wisdom directly to you...

                    You are provided with a ship, supplies, and a pilot you return you home. Several hours into your voyage your spaceship suddenly changes course.
                    You confront the pilot but he pays no attention to you. Soon after, you arrive at an inhabited meteor station which was not a planned destination on way back home.
                    Unbeknownst to you, the meteor station is actually a prison which the pilot has sold you off to enslavement.

                    Can you go back to living a normal life? Can you even speak about what you've experienced?
                    what will people say and will they even believe you?
