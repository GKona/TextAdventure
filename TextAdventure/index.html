                It occurs to you that you've forgotten where you're going, as you stand there you notice a wallet infront of your feet. 
                The streets appear earily silent as you scan your surrounding for the owner of the wallet.
                <br />
                ..."Pick it up already!", the thought echoes in your mind over and over again, 
                as if a greater power is trying to communicate great wisdom directly to you...
