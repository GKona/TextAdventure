                    You are walking down a street all by your lonesome.<br />
                    It occurs to you that you've forgotten where you were going in the first place.
                    As you stand there, you notice a wallet before your feet.
                    The streets appear earily silent as you scan your surrounding for the owner of the wallet or police officers.

                    ..."Pick it up already!", the thought echoes in your mind over and over again,

                    Your scuffle has attracted the attention of a couple of police officers.
                    Before you get a chance to speak, the officers demand you place your hands behind your head and step away from the man on the ground.

                <p>
                    You try to explain that the man was trying to mug you but the officers only get more aggresive. You slowly reach into your back pocket to retreive the wallet you found while stating your intentions to the officers.
                    They believe you to be reaching for a weapon and they shoot without warning.

                    You lie there bleeding on the ground with the wallet still in your hand and a bullet in the head.
